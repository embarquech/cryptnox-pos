 * Every constant here has a testnet twin above and is read through exactly the

 * deployments as of 2026-09, and a wrong one moves real money into the wrong
 * asset. All must have decimals() == 6, as everywhere else.
 *
 * An address whose EIP-55 case is wrong fails its parse at boot and disables that
 * one asset with a log line — so a typo here is a refusal, never a wrong charge.

 * A network switch takes effect on a restart: the endpoints and contracts are
 * resolved once at boot into the dual stores, and the config page restarts the
