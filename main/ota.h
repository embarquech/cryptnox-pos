 * @file ota.h
 * @ingroup device
 * @brief Firmware slot handling: receive an image into the idle slot, verify it,
 *        and install it only once somebody accepts it on the panel.
 *
 * This file owns the flash, not the network. The bytes arrive through the config
 * portal (provision.h), which serves the update page and drives the three-call
 * streaming API below; keeping the two apart means the partition logic is not
 * entangled with a web server, and the portal has exactly one place to POST to.
 *
 * Why the browser is the courier rather than esp_https_ota, which would be a tenth
 * of the code: because that makes every terminal in the field open a connection to
 * a third party who then knows how many units exist, where they are and which
 * firmware each one runs. A payment terminal should not be the thing that
 * publishes that. So:
 *
 *     you              download the image somewhere with internet
 *     browser --HTTP--> http://192.168.4.1/api/ota   (streamed to flash)
 *
 * Consequence for the operator: the file has to be on the phone or laptop before
 * they join the terminal's setup network, because that network has no route
 * anywhere. The portal used to offer a release-list check as well; it is gone,
 * along with the URL it fetched — see docs/ota.md.
 *
 * Threat model. What keeps a stranger's firmware off the device is not the
 * transport and not the admin code: it is the signature
 * (CONFIG_SECURE_SIGNED_ON_UPDATE_NO_SECURE_BOOT, see sdkconfig.defaults.release).
 * @ref ota_end refuses an image that is not signed by the key this firmware was
 * built against, and it does so *before* the staged slot can become bootable. On
 * top of that the portal only runs when an operator turns it on from behind the
 * admin code, it closes itself, and nothing reboots until the received version is
 * accepted on the panel — the same "a browser may propose, only the panel may
 * accept" rule the payout addresses follow.
