 * @brief The config portal: one web app for setting a terminal up and for
 *        administering it afterwards, in two modes.
 *
 * ## Why a portal at all
 *
 * Typing a 42-character recipient address on a 240x320 resistive panel is the
 * worst part of setting one of these up, and telling an operator to type an IP
 * address is only marginally better. Scanning a QR code should land them on the
 * form.
 *
 * ## One transport: the terminal's own SoftAP
 *
 * Both modes raise a WPA2 SoftAP with a fresh per-session passphrase and run a
 * captive portal on it: a DNS responder answers every lookup with the AP's
 * address, and the HTTP server deliberately fails each OS's connectivity probe so
 * the phone concludes the network is captive and opens the browser by itself. Miss
 * either half and the phone joins in silence. The QR code on the panel carries
 * "WIFI:T:WPA;S:...;P:...;;", which both iOS and Android cameras join from
 * directly — so there is never a URL to type.
 *
 * The AP is the *only* interface while a portal is up: @ref net_ap_start drops the
 * station association and @ref net_ap_stop restores it. That is not tidiness.
 * esp_http_server binds every interface and offers no bind address, so a portal
 * running beside a station association also answers the venue LAN — where every
 * device holding the venue PSK can reach the payout forms, and where the perimeter
 * this module actually relies on (a passphrase on the panel, in front of the
 * person asking) means nothing at all. So there is no remote administration here,
 * by construction: you are in front of the terminal or you are nowhere.
 *
 * What that buys, besides the smaller attack surface, is one transport instead of
 * two — no TLS server, no self-signed identity in NVS, no certificate warning to
 * explain on a panel, and no second code path through the same forms.
 *
 * ## The two modes
 *
 * @ref PROV_MODE_WIZARD — a blank terminal, or one whose saved network has become
 * unreachable. Walks the setup steps one at a time and stays up until setup ends.
 *
 * @ref PROV_MODE_ADMIN — a configured terminal, opened from behind the admin code
 * in the settings menu. Serves everything at once and closes itself after
 * @ref PROV_WINDOW_MIN, because it has taken a working terminal off its network to
 * do this.
 *
 * ## Authorisation: the panel, never the wire
 *
 * The browser has no admin-code field. It asks to be let in, and the terminal
 * shows its admin-code screen; the operator types the code *on the panel*, and the
 * portal session becomes authorised. So the code never crosses the network in
 * either direction, on either mode's transport, and a browser that reaches the
 * page without the terminal in reach can do nothing at all.
 *
 * One exception, and it is the wizard's alone: @ref prov_set_wifi_only, the flow a
 * configured terminal gets when all it has lost is its network. See there.
 *
 * Everything that changes where money goes goes further than that: a browser may
 * *propose* a payout address or a token contract, and the value is then displayed
 * on the panel for somebody to accept there. Nothing is stored until they do.
 * Firmware follows the same rule — an upload is verified and staged, and only an
 * on-screen accept makes it bootable.
 *
 * ## Why plain HTTP, in both modes
 *
 * Not an oversight:
 *   - A captive-portal probe fetches a bare http:// URL on port 80 and will not
 *     follow us to 443. TLS means the browser never opens by itself, which is the
 *     entire point of a captive portal.
 *   - The link is already encrypted. It is a WPA2 SoftAP whose random per-session
 *     passphrase is on the panel in front of the operator, it admits one station
 *     at a time, and it only exists while the portal does.
 *   - The admin code is not on that link (see above), and the values that are get
 *     confirmed on the panel.
 *   - There is nothing else on the wire to protect it from: the AP is the radio's
 *     only interface for as long as the portal is up.
 * So the AP passphrase is the perimeter, and TLS on top of WPA2 would buy a
 * certificate warning and nothing else.
