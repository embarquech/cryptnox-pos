 * test_portal_render.js — headless test of the config portal page's render logic.
 *
 * `check_portal_page.py` proves the script parses and that its element ids exist.
 * This proves it shows the right thing: which sections are visible for each
 * (mode, step, authed, pending) the device can report. That logic is a hand-written
 * pile of booleans in `render()`, it decides whether the operator can complete
 * setup at all, and nothing else tests it.
 *
 * What it is specifically there to catch:
 *   - an unauthorised browser being shown anything it could submit;
 *   - the wizard showing two steps at once, or none;
 *   - a value waiting on the panel while the page still invites another;
 *   - the admin page growing a wizard Continue button, or vice versa.
 *
 * Run from the repo root (needs python for the extractor):
 *
 *   python tools/check_portal_page.py --emit-js build/portal_page.js
 *   node tools/test_portal_render.js build/portal_page.js
