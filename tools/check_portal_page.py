"""Extract the config portal's page from provision.cpp and check it parses.

The page is a pair of C string literals compiled into the firmware, so the
compiler proves the C is valid and nothing proves the HTML or the JavaScript is.
A typo in there is a wizard that cannot be completed, on a device with no console
to read — which is a worse failure than anything the C compiler catches.

So: pull the literals out, un-escape them, and hand the <script> body to
`node --check`. Also asserts every id the script reaches for exists in the markup,
which is the other half of the same class of bug.

    python tools/check_portal_page.py

Exit status 0 and "portal page OK", or a diagnosis. No dependencies beyond node.
