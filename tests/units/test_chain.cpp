 * test_chain.cpp — host unit test for the chain predicates in main/settings.h.
 *
 * Two things are worth a test here, and both cost money when they are wrong.
 *
 * Which family a selection belongs to decides which signing path runs, which
 * payout address is spent and which endpoint the transaction is broadcast to.
 * While Sepolia was the only EVM chain, "not Sepolia" meant Tron and both
 * main.cpp and ui.cpp said so in their own one-liner; Polygon made that answer
 * wrong in two places at once. So every enumerator is classified here, and
 * classified exactly once — a chain that is neither Tron nor Polygon is on
 * Ethereum by elimination, so a new one nobody added to a predicate silently
 * becomes an Ethereum chain and gets signed with Sepolia's chain id.
 *
 * The numbers are pinned because they are persisted in NVS. Renumbering the
 * enum would leave a terminal that stored 2 charging in whatever now sits at 2 —
 * a different asset, or a different network, with no visible change.
 *
 * Header-only unit, no ESP-IDF. Build & run from the repo root:
 *
 *   g++ -std=c++14 -Imain tests/units/test_chain.cpp -o test_chain && ./test_chain
