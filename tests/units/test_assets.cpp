 * test_assets.cpp — host unit test for the asset descriptor table in main/assets.h.
 *
 * The table replaced four parallel switches and three hand-written picker tables
 * in ui.cpp. That trade is only worth making if the table is complete: a switch
 * with a `default` renders SOMETHING for a chain nobody added, and a table with a
 * missing row would too (pos_asset_of falls back), which is the same silent-wrong
 * failure moved to a new address. So the completeness that used to be "did you
 * remember all ten edit sites" is asserted here instead.
 *
 * Header-only unit, no ESP-IDF. Build & run from the repo root:
 *
 *   g++ -std=c++14 -Imain tests/units/test_assets.cpp -o test_assets && ./test_assets
